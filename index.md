I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at Iowa State University.

My research areas is on Sample Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

I did my Master's in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University, wherein I worked on developing cheap and biocompatible graphene using ball milling techniques.

Here is a list of my publications -
