## Deepak George Thomas

I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at Iowa State University.

My research areas is on Sample Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

I did my Master's in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University, wherein I worked on developing cheap and biocompatible graphene using ball milling techniques.

Here is a list of my publications - 

•	Thomas, Deepak-George, et al. "Interpretable UAV Collision Avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.12254 (2021) [Submitted to CoRL 2021].

•	Thomas, Deepak-George, et al. "Protein-assisted scalable mechanochemical exfoliation of few-layer biocompatible graphene nanosheets." Royal Society open science 8.3 (2021): 200911.

•	Shihab, Syed Arbab Mohd, et al. "Towards the Next Generation Airline Revenue Management: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Seat Inventory Control and Overbooking." arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.06824 (2019).
